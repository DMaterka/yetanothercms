    REQUIREMENT DETAILS
    ===================
     - You must NOT use any Complete PHP Frameworks, like Zend, Symfony, Joomla, Drupal, etc.!
     - You ARE allowed to use any 3rd party code library, as a PART of Your solution, like Prototype, jQuery, Smarty, YAML, etc...
     - If you encounter any problems with server or workstation configuration - report them immediately. We are not testing you on those and we don't want you to lose time on trying to fix them
     - Focus on Quality not Quantity. Write a quality code - it is WAY MORE important than completing everything. We want to know how you design solutions, what design patterns you use and what your general approach to programming is.
